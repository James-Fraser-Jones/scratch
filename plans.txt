-Add navmesh offset back in but you'll have to implement polygon inflation yourself to avoid vertex duplication
-Look into how flocking behaviours are coded for boids, try to make enemies do it and see if you can make it fluid
-Maybe rewrite the map generation script to simplify it for the actual use case of generating polygons
-Maybe also write code that simplifies away unnecessary vertices in the generated polygons (perhaps not really necessary)
-Also consider whether 2/sec frequency on path updating is reasonable for enemy AI and whether that contributes to current poor movement behavior
