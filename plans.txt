For terrain generation:
-We can do perlin noise + marching squares with interpolation
-We can do multiple layers of varying frequencies to generate:
	-Landscape
	-Hills
	-Boulders
	-Obstacles
	-Etc..
-Then we OR them all together to get the final map
-But also, higher layers can influence lower ones by acting as a multiplier to influence lower layers to avoid/coincide with higher ones (athough cutoff point will need to be increased to compensate)
-Then we could also have procedural structures/buildings etc..

For now, we need 1 layer of perlin noise, interpolated marching squares + an external wall
this is going to clash with the auto-generated navigation :/
